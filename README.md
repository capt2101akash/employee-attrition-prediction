Designing an algorithm 
Any organization whether small or large depends on its employee for its smooth running of 
operations and tasks in the organization which then help it to achieve the objectives and goals set 
for the year.  
But if the rate at which employees leave the organization is high, it will not only lead to additional 
cost bearing by the organization but will also hamper the workflow system. 
Given the above usefulness of studying the factors leading to employees leaving the organization, 
our team has decided to predict the employee attrition based on variables like Age,  Gender etc. 
Employee attrition tells the organization of how well it is managing the talent pool. If the employee 
attrition rate  is high  it shows that the workforce  is  decreasing which can be due  to a number of 
factors such as not adequate compensation, incentives etc.  
Knowing how many employees are going to leave the organization due to several reasons will help 
the organization to plan beforehand and take up activities that will decrease the attrition rate.  
The employee attrition prediction will lead to threefold benefit for the organization- 
1. Adequate  staffing  -  There  will  never  be  less  number  of  employees  as  those  leaving  the 
organization will quickly be compensated by new joiners. 
2. Decreased onboarding cost - Organization can use the predicted value to devise strategies 
for employee retention which will lead to low onboarding costs.  
3. Retain human capital, the core asset of an organization.
